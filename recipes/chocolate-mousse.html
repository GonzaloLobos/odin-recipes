  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This chocolate mousse for beginners is the all-time easiest method, perfect for beginners, but even experts may want to pay attention, because this technique produces the most delicious, most perfectly-textured mousse I've ever had.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 1/2 ounces dark chocolate (62% cacao is ideal)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>1 tiny pinch salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chilled heavy whipping cream</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Break up or chop chocolate into small pieces and set aside with butter.</li>
    <li>Add egg yolks, sugar, water, and salt to a metal mixing bowl. Cook, whisking, directly over medium-low heat until the mixture is thick, foamy, and hot to the touch (145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C)). </li>
    <li>Once the yolk mixture is thick and hot, add chocolate and butter, and whisk until all chocolate is melted. Let rest for a few minutes on the counter, whisking occasionally to further cool the mixture to just above or at room temperature. The chocolate mixture shouldnâ€™t go into the whipped cream while still warm, but if cooled too long, the mixture may get too firm to fold in.</li>
    <li>Whisk cold cream until medium stiff peaks form. If cream is whisked further, it will separate and the final texture will be grainy.</li>
    <li>Transfer about 1/3 of chocolate mixture into whipped cream, and fold with a spatula until almost incorporated. Gently fold in remaining chocolate, trying to keep as much air in the mixture as possible.</li>
    <li>Transfer into 4 serving dishes, wrap, and chill before serving, at least 1 hour.</li>
  </ol>
